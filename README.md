# History Cube
This respository contains the code for the history cube CLI which displays daily history facts.

## Install
Clone this repository and cd into the directory:

```
cd history_cube/
bundle
```

This project uses API Ninjas to get the History facts. You'll need to create an account there https://api-ninjas.com/

Once your account is created add a config.yml file at the root of this project with your api key:

```
api_key: YOUR_API_NINJA_KEY
```

## About
This code is part of a bigger project where I've created a tutorial on how to make a history cube project: https://medium.com/@mikewittenauer/building-the-history-cube-part-one-ruby-terminal-app-404baedc1e4f
